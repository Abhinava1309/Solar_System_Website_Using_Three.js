# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

Welcome to the **Solar System Simulation** — a web-based interactive 3D visualization of the solar system built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. This project is aimed at providing an educational and visually engaging way to explore the planetary orbits and celestial bodies in our solar system.

---

## 📜 Description

This project simulates the solar system using simple animation and JavaScript logic. The planets are rendered as animated components, each revolving around the sun in a circular orbit. It’s built with modern frontend technologies for optimal performance and development experience.

You can:
- Visualize how planets orbit the sun.
- Understand the scale of orbits (conceptually).
- Interact with a responsive UI.
- Use or extend the codebase for learning, experimentation, or academic purposes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **Component-Based Structure** — Built with modular React components.
- ⚡ **Vite-Powered** — Ultra-fast dev server and bundling.
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** — Easily customizable and mobile responsive.
- 🌀 **Orbit Animation** — Planets revolve using custom animation logic.
- 📦 **TypeScript Support** — Strongly typed code for safer development.
- 🧪 Easy to modify and extend for learning or teaching.
